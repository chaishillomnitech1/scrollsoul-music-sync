---

#### Company Profile

**Company:** TechCorp Global  
**Industry:** Technology/Software  
**Size:** 5,000 employees  
**Locations:** 47 countries  
**Revenue:** $500M annually  
**Challenge:** Fragmented music licensing, low employee engagement, high turnover  

---

#### The Challenge

**Situation:**

TechCorp Global, a rapidly growing SaaS company, faced multiple challenges with their music and employee engagement programs:

**Music Licensing Issues:**
- Using 7 different music vendors across regions
- Spending $340K annually on licensing
- 3-6 month negotiation cycles for each license
- Compliance nightmares across 47 countries
- No centralized system or analytics

**Employee Engagement Problems:**
- Engagement scores: 42% (industry average: 65%)
- Annual turnover: 28% (costing $2.8M in recruitment/training)
- Traditional rewards (gift cards) generated minimal excitement
- Remote workforce felt disconnected from company culture
- Gen Z employees (40% of workforce) wanted modern benefits

**Quote from Sarah Thompson, VP of HR:**
> "We were spending a fortune on fragmented solutions that weren't working. Our music licensing was a mess. Our employee rewards were outdated. We needed a unified, modern approach."

3. **White-Label Music Platform**
   - Branded as "TechCorp Sounds"
   - Custom domain: music.techcorp.com
