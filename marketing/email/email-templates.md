# Email Marketing Templates - ScrollSoul

## 🚀 Launch Announcement Sequence

### Email 1: Product Launch (Day 1)
**Subject:** Introducing ScrollSoul: Music Licensing Meets Blockchain 🎵💰

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Big news! After 18 months of development, we're thrilled to announce the launch of ScrollSoul - the world's first music sync platform with blockchain-powered employee rewards.

What is ScrollSoul?

✅ Instant music licensing (100K+ tracks)
✅ Crypto employee rewards
✅ White-label platform
✅ 3-line API integration

The Problem We Solve:
Traditional music licensing is slow (3-6 months), expensive ($10K-$500K+), and offers zero employee engagement. We fix all of that.

Special Launch Offer:
🎁 Free for first 90 days (Enterprise tier)
🎁 $10K crypto rewards pool included
🎁 Dedicated onboarding specialist

Ready to transform your music experience?

### Email 2: Value Proposition (Day 3)
**Subject:** Save $240K/year on music licensing (real customer data)

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much is your company spending on music licensing?

Our client TechCorp Global was spending $340K/year on fragmented music solutions. With ScrollSoul, they now spend $100K - saving $240K annually.

But here's the best part...

Their employee engagement scores increased 84% thanks to our crypto reward system.

How? When employees create playlists, attend events, or engage with company music, they receive cryptocurrency rewards automatically.

The Math:
- $240K saved on licensing
- $180K saved on reduced turnover (47% improvement)
- 23% productivity increase (priceless)

Total Annual Impact: $420K+

### Template 2: CTO Focus
**Subject:** 3-line API integration (music + crypto)

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Fellow engineer here (former Spotify VP of Engineering).

I built something I wish I had at Spotify - a music licensing API that takes 3 lines of code:

```javascript
import { ScrollSoul } from 'scrollsoul-sdk';
const client = new ScrollSoul({ apiKey: 'your-key' });
await client.music.license({ track: 'trending' });
```

Done. You now have:
✅ Licensed music (100K+ tracks)
✅ Crypto rewards for employees
✅ Analytics dashboard

[Company Name] could integrate this in < 2 hours.
